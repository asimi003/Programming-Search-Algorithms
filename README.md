Description:

Programmed 3 search algorithms from scratch: uniform cost search, A* with misplaced tile heuristic, and A* with euclidean distance heuristic. Given 6 different levels of difficulties of an 8 puzzle. Tested each of the 3 different algorithms try to solve each of the puzzle difficulties and was given the number of steps of the optimal solution path of each algorithm per puzzle as well as the time spent.
